# Awesome Social Music Sequencer

Mess around with it at http://wtfnewyork.com

Only chrome and firefox are supported.

Basically, you upload audio sample wav files (or whatever else your
[browser supports](http://caniuse.com/#feat=audio)) and arrange
them on a timeline to make small compositions.

Basic functionality is implemented. There's a TODO, if you want to
peer into the future.

Its developed in rails 4 and ruby 2.
